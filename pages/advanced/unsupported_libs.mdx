# Unsupported libraries

<Caution>
    This is an experimental feature and should be used with caution. Consider alternatives before adding external libraries this way.
</Caution>

This guide provides information how to include libraries that the app doesn't use.

## Configuration

To include external libraries that aren't part of the main application, you'll need to use the `fatImplementation` configuration instead of the standard `implementation` in your Gradle build file.

For instance, using 

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // DON'T use this
    // implementation("com.example.network:NetworkClient:1.0.0")
    
    // Instead, use fatImplementation
    fatImplementation("com.example.network:NetworkClient:1.0.0")
}
```

## Important notes

- The `fatImplementation` configuration ensures that the library and its dependencies are properly bundled with the package that the gradle command, `:make`, creates.
- Using `fatImplementation` will increase your provider's file size and build time.
- Some libraries might not work correctly when bundled this way.
- Using the standard `implementation` configuration may result in runtime errors such as:
  - `ClassNotFoundException`
  - `MethodNotFoundException`
  - `NoClassDefFoundError`
