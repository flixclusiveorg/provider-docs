# Coding style

This guide will go over some tips on how to standardize your code so everybody can contribute to it. It's *not necessary* to read this section of the docs if you have your own coding preferences.

<Note>
    Kotlin docs has its own [coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#directory-structure).
</Note>

## The DOs 

This section explains the preferred code style for achieving code readability.

### Prefer descriptive names

Choose names that convey the purpose of the variable, function, or class.

### Use identations and spaces

Please *FFS*, code like a sane person and use proper spaces and tabs when coding-it is more readable that way.

- Bad example:
    ```kotlin
    val listOfApis = listOf("API1","API2","API3","API4")
    val listOfExtractors = listOf("EX1","EX2")
    // ❌
    ```

- Good example:
    ```kotlin
    val listOfApis = listOf(
        "API1",
        "API2",
        "API3",
        "API4"
    )
    val listOfExtractors = listOf("EX1", "EX2")
    // ✅
    ```

### Organize code by feature

Always group related classes together by *feature*, not by type. This structure makes it easier to find everything related to a specific feature in one place.

```
└── com.example.testProvider/
    ├── api/
    │   ├── TestProviderApi.kt
    │   └── ... other API related files
    ├── settings/
    │   ├── MySettingsScreen.kt
    │   └── ... other compose related files
    ├── common/
    │   └── ... helper classes/methods
    └── TestProvider.kt
```

### Keep methods short and focused

Aim for small methods that perform a single task, improving readability and maintainability.

- Bad example:
    ```kotlin
    override suspend fun getLinks(
        // ...
    ) {
        // Fetch API
        // Parse HTML
        // Execute extractor
        // Return to callback
    }
    // ❌
    ```

- Good example:
    ```kotlin
    override suspend fun getLinks(
        // ...
    ) {
        val response = fetchApi(...)
        val html = parseResponse(...)
        val links = extractor.run(...)
        
        for (link in links) {
            onLinkLoaded(link)
        }
    }
    // ✅
    ```

### Create reusable components

When implementing your provider's settings UI, it's preferred to extract common settings UI patterns into composable functions:

<Note>
    This also applies to non-Compose code.
</Note>

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SwitchPreference(
    title: String,
    checked: Boolean,
    onCheckedChange: (Boolean) -> Unit,
) {
    // ...
}

@Composable
fun TextPreference(
    title: String,
    value: Boolean,
    onValueChange: (String) -> Unit,
) {
    // ...
}

@Composable
fun SettingsCategory(
    title: String,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    // ...
}

@Composable
fun SettingsItem(
    title: String,
    description: String? = null,
    icon: @Composable (() -> Unit)? = null,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    // ...
}
```

## The DONTs

This section explains the pitfalls to avoid to when achieving code readability.

### Avoid the elvis operator

The `?:` operator does make development faster but new people might get confused to it. This can easily be replaced by a simple conditional `if (x != null)`.

### Avoid premature abstraction

It's the need to create an interface that only has one implementation. This only obfuscates the code and makes code reading more difficult and slow.

### Avoid overly complex expressions

When creating providers, the tendency to combine too many operations in a single line is difficult to avoid. This can make code difficult to read and maintain. Prioritize readability by breaking complex expressions into multiple, simpler statements.

- Bad example:
    ```kotlin
    val catalogNames = catalogs
        .filter { it.isMovie }
        .map { it.name }
        .sortedByDescending { it.name }
        .take(5)
    // ❌
    ```

- Good example:
    ```kotlin
    val movieCatalogs = catalogs.filter { it.isMovie }
    val namesOfMovieCatalogs = movieCatalogs.map { it.name }
    val topFiveMovieCatalogs = doubledValues.sortedDescending().take(5)
    // ✅
    ```

### Avoid excessive comments

Always aim to write self-explanatory code with meaningful variable so there'd be no need to add extra comments. Only add comments to explain *why* a code does it and not *what* it does.

### Avoid overly long naming conventions

While descriptive names are important for code readability, excessively long names can make code cumbersome and difficult to follow.

- Bad example:
    ```kotlin
    fun getSubtitlesAndStreamsFromApi(): List<MediaLink>
        = // ...
    // ❌
    ```

- Good example:
    ```kotlin
    fun getMediaLinks(): List<MediaLink>
        = // ...
    // ✅
    ```
