# Other questions

### Is it required to install providers?

*No*. Like many browser extensions, they are purely optional to install, but you are free to do so.

### Is there a security drawback for installing a provider?

Yes. Each provider accessible through the app is not securely monitored by the author(s) of the app.

When you install a provider, _it can access the whole context of the app_ such as device storage, notifications, etc. which is considerably a common security flaw for android apps.

Installing a provider is entirely up to your judgment, with all risks and responsibilities falling on you. Trust or not to trust? It's up to you!

### Why implement the provider system? It is confusing.

It is to tailor the experiences and customize the user preferences. This way, we can also increase user engagement and have more people use the app.

It also prioritizes building a developer-friendly community. Nerds ðŸ¤“ and non-nerds can create a community based on their similar interests and needs that are related to the app.

Lastly, it is to separate the responsibilities of the providers from the app. Issues related to providers are incredibly hard to maintain.

### Other apps have better _extension_ system. Why should I use this?

Yes, definitely! Use those apps instead for a better user experience. The app is still in its early stages, and we can not expect major updates in immediate time.
