# What is a provider?

<Tip>The app acts as the browser while a provider acts as a browser extension</Tip>

How do you use your desktop browsers? Do you have AdBlocks on it? If so, providers are the _same_.

To keep it simple and short, a **provider** is an optional extension of the app's vanilla capabilities to provide you with what content you best prefer.

### Provider structure

        ### Provider information (summarized)
        - Logo of the provider
        - Name of the provider
        - Author/s of the providers
        - Content provided
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Version of the provider
        The provider system recommends using [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) for the versions of the providers.
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Provider toggle
        - In the app, you are allowed to disable/enable providers.
        - Disabling providers means that the app will not use it for content generation.
        - For instance, if a provider contains catalogs and it is disabled, it will not be rendered on the home and search screens.
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Provider's settings
        - Providers have their own settings which means that they are dynamically configurable based on user and author preferences.
        - If a provider asks for a configuration, then check its provider settings.
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Provider's status
        Providers will tell you if they are working or not. The list of available statuses are:
        - ðŸŸ¢ Working
        - ðŸ”´ Down
        - ðŸŸ¡ Maintenance
        - ðŸ”µ Beta
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Drag icon
        - The app lets you organize and order which provider will be called up first when generating content.
        - To organize providers, press and hold a provider card then drag it to the desired order.
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Soâ€¦ where do I get providers?

Providers are made by other developers/programmers and, currently, _GitHub repositories_ are the main source of these providers. Similar sites like GitLab and Codeberg are not yet fully supported.
