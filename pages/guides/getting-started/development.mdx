# Development

### 1. Setting Up Your IDE

1. Open the project in Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA
2. Sync Gradle files
3. Ensure the Kotlin plugin is enabled
4. Set up your run configurations:
   ```bash
   # For basic build
   ./gradlew :YourProvider:make

   # For deployment to device
   ./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb
   ```

### 2. Development Commands

During development, you can use these Gradle tasks:

```bash
# Build your provider
./gradlew :YourProvider:make

# Deploy to device with debugging
./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb --debug-app

# Deploy and wait for debugger attachment
./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb --wait-for-debugger
```

### 3. Debugging Tips

- Use the "Test provider" option in the app for quick testing
- Attach debugger through Android Studio:
  1. Run with `--wait-for-debugger` flag
  2. Click "Attach debugger to Android process"
  3. Select your provider process

## Best Practices for Provider Development

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep your provider code modular
   - Use meaningful package names
   - Follow Kotlin coding conventions

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle network failures gracefully

3. **Testing**
   - Test your provider thoroughly
   - Include different network conditions
   - Verify error cases

4. **Documentation**
   - Document your provider's functionality
   - Include setup instructions
   - List any special requirements
