# Development

This guide will provide brief insights for building and running your own provider.

<Tip>It is *recommended* to convert all commands displayed below onto custom configurations provided by Android Studio itself.</Tip>

## Building a provider

To build and package your provider, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew :YourProvider:make
```

## Deployment

To deploy the provider on an emulator or a device, choose the following command that fits your needs:
<Tabs items={["Using the pre/release app", "Using the debug app"]}>
   <Tabs.Tab>
      If you are developing using the *release* or *pre-release* version of the app, run the following command:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb
      ```
   </Tabs.Tab>
   <Tabs.Tab>
      If you are developing using the *debug* app, run the following command:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb --debug-app
      ```
   </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Debugging

There might be cases that you'll find yourself wanting to use the built-in debugger of Android Studio. The following steps should guide you how to configure it for your provider.

      ### Using the debugger option

      The command below will deploy and wait for debugger attachment:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew :YourProvider:deployWithAdb --wait-for-debugger
      ```
   </Steps.Step>
   <Steps.Step>
      ### Attaching the debugger

      Click the **"Attach debugger to Android process"** button on the top-right corner of the IDE. It looks like a bug that has a blue diagonal arrow.

      Lastly, select the Flixclusive process to let IDE attach its debugger to the app.
   </Steps.Step>
