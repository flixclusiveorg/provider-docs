# Configuration

This guide assumes that you have completed all [Getting Started](/getting-started/installation) steps. By the end of this guide, you will know how to configure your provider’s information and create a new provider called `TestProvider`.

## Gradle setup

The template repository already includes this setup, but it’s still recommended to read through this section to prevent potential build errors.

Every provider you create relies on two core APIs to function correctly. These APIs contain the Gradle tasks, API methods, and extensions you’ll need for creating and packaging your provider.

### Core gradle plugin

This plugin provides the tasks and extensions used by Kotlin DSL to help package all your providers.

It’s implemented in the root project `build.gradle.kts` file as a dependency using the following code:
```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        // ... other repositories
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }

    dependencies {
        // ... other dependencies

        val latestVersion = "..."
        // Flixclusive gradle plugin which facilitates provider creation and builds
        classpath("com.github.flixclusiveorg.core-gradle:core-gradle:$latestVersion")
    }
}
```
<Note>The latest version of the core Gradle plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/flixclusiveorg/core-gradle/releases/latest).</Note>

Then, apply the Flixclusive provider plugin as follows. You can do this in either the project-level or module-level `build.gradle.kts` file.

<CodeGroup>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='build.gradle.kts (project level)'>
        ```kotlin
        subprojects {
            apply(plugin = "flx-provider")
            // ...
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='build.gradle.kts (module level)'>
        ```kotlin
        plugins {
            id("flx-provider")
            // ... other plugins
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
</CodeGroup>

### Core stubs library

This library contains all stubs, entities, and utility classes required to develop a provider.

It’s used as a regular library and can be implemented at either the project or module level in the `build.gradle.kts` file.

<CodeGroup>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='build.gradle.kts (project level)'>
        ```kotlin
        subprojects {
            // ...
            
            dependencies {
                val implementation by configurations
                val testImplementation by configurations
                // ... other configurations

                val coreStubsModule = "com.github.flixclusiveorg.core-stubs:provider"
                val coreStubsVersion = "..."

                implementation("$coreStubsModule:$coreStubsVersion")
                testImplementation("$coreStubsModule:$coreStubsVersion")
                // ... other dependencies
            }
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='build.gradle.kts (module level)'>
        ```kotlin
        dependencies {
            val coreStubsModule = "com.github.flixclusiveorg.core-stubs:provider"
            val coreStubsVersion = "..."

            implementation("$coreStubsModule:$coreStubsVersion")
            testImplementation("$coreStubsModule:$coreStubsVersion")
            // ... other dependencies
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
</CodeGroup>
<Note>The latest version of the core stubs library can be found [here](https://github.com/flixclusiveorg/core-stubs/releases/latest).</Note>

## Configuring `settings.gradle.kts`

This section involves *manually* editing and adding files to your project.

### Changing the project structure

<Tip>The template repository already uses a recommended project structure, where all provider modules are stored in the `providers` folder. You can skip this step if your project follows this setup.</Tip>

To create a new provider called `TestProvider` with its own folder at the root project level rather than inside the `providers` folder, remove the following code from `settings.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
rootProject.children.forEach {
    it.projectDir = file("providers/${it.name}")
}
```

Alternatively, if you want to rename the `providers` folder to something else, like `extensions`, modify the code as follows:
```kotlin
rootProject.children.forEach {
    it.projectDir = file("extensions/${it.name}")
}
```

### Creating new providers

<Note>This section also applies when *deleting* or *renaming* a provider module.</Note>

While template providers are included in the repository, it’s likely that you’ll create additional providers in the future.

Assuming you created a `TestProvider` folder for a new custom provider, Android Studio requires you to include this module in the project settings to recognize it as part of the project.

To do this, modify `settings.gradle.kts` as follows:
```kotlin
include(
    "BasicDummyProvider",
    "BasicDummyWebViewProvider",
    "TestProvider",                 // <- newly created provider
)
```

## Customizing the provider data

Every provider needs enough information to identify itself and declare its capabilities. This is represented by the `ProviderData` class. The `TestProvider` provider will be used here on this part of this guide as an example on how to customize its provider data.

The properties of the entity class are customizable through the [`flxProvider`](https://github.com/flixclusiveorg/provider-template/blob/f52ec47031b411ec590c50d7e45c6ffdfc1b61ec/build.gradle.kts#L32) extension provided by the [custom plugin](#core-gradle-plugin) mentioned earlier.


### Basic identity

<Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Name (optional)

        <Tip>Manually set the name of your provider if it requires spaces or unsupported symbols.</Tip>

        The name of the provider. This is optional to configure as the gradle plugin *automatically* inherits the module/project name of the provider package.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            providerName.set("Test Provider")
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Version

        The version of the provider should follow semver. It contains four versions:
        - major version
        - minor version
        - patch version
        - build version

        These four produce two outputs, a stringified (called version name) and an integer/long output (called version code).

        For instance, if we have the following versions:
        ```
        major = 3
        minor = 2
        patch = 0
        build = 2
        ```

        The version name should output a string like `3.2.0`. Notice how build is not included in the version name.

        On the other hand, the version code contains the integer version and would output something like `32002`

        ---

        To set the versions, use the following code as a guide:
        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            versionMajor = 1
            versionMinor = 0
            versionPatch = 0
            versionBuild = 0
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Status

        The current operational state of your provider. These are the possible values you could set:
        - [Status.Beta](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-status/-beta/index.html)
        - [Status.Maintenance](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-status/-maintenance/index.html)
        - [Status.Down](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-status/-down/index.html)
        - [Status.Working](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-status/-working/index.html)

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            status.set(Status.Working)
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Authors (optional)

        For accreditation purposes, the provider allows displaying the rightful owners of the provider. This can be helpful if you need to plug your github portfolio or dev community.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            author(
                name = "flixclusiveorg",
                image = "http://github.com/flixclusiveorg.png",
                socialLink = "http://github.com/flixclusiveorg",
            )
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Description (optional)

        The description of whatever your provider does.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            description.set(
                """
                Some description here.
                """.trimIndent()
            )
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Icon (optional)

        This serves a visual representation of your provider in the app.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            iconUrl.set("https://example.com/my_image.png")
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Source information

<Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Repository URL

        This sets where users can find your provider's source code and what the core gradle plugin will use as a basis to find the updater file in your repository.

        <Tip>It is recommended to use this code on the project level `build.gradle.kts` file.</Tip>

        ```kotlin
        // Project level build.gradle.kts

        fun Project.flxProvider(configuration: FlixclusiveProviderExtension.() -> Unit)
            = extensions.getFlixclusive().configuration()

        subprojects {
            //...

            flxProvider {
                setRepository("https://github.com/flixclusiveorg/providers-template")
                // ... other custom properties
            }
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Changelogs (optional)

        This should contain all the changes your provider had gone through from its recent updates. This supports [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            changelog.set(
                """
                # 1.2.3
                ---

                Some changes here.
                """.trimIndent()
            )
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Content specifications

<Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Content type

        This displays whether your provider handles content for movies, series, both, or a custom one. These are the possible values you could set:
        - [ProviderType.All](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-provider-type/-companion/-all.html)
        - [ProviderType.TvShows](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-provider-type/-companion/-tv-shows.html)
        - [ProviderType.Movies](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-provider-type/-companion/-movies.html)
        - [ProviderType(customType: String)](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-provider-type/index.html)


        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            providerType.set(ProviderType.All)
            // providerType.set(ProviderType("Anime"))
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Language

        This tells the app what language this provider supports. These are the possible values you could set:
        - [Language.Multiple](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-language/-companion/-multiple.html)
        - [Language(languageCode: String)](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-language/index.html)


        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            language.set(Language.Multiple)
            // language.set(Language("en"))
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Adult content (optional)

        This sets whether the provider is for adult only.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            adult.set(false)
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Build specifications

This part is not included on the `ProviderData` entity but it is required for `ProviderManifest` and build options when you're finally running the provider in the app. Most properties here are optional.

<Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Requires resources (optional)

        This flag tells the core gradle plugin that your provider uses its own resources (i.e., images, vectors, strings, etc.). Failure to toggle this option while you have resources might lead to runtime exceptions.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            requiresResources.set(false)
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        #### Unpublish provider (optional)

        <Tip>Use this when you're still testing out a beta provider and you are required to push it on your remote publicly.</Tip>

        This flag tells the core gradle plugin that your provider should be unpublished and not be included on the final providers list that it will build. It will *hide* the provider from the downloads list on your repository page.

        ```kotlin
        flxProvider {
            excludeFromUpdaterJson.set(false)
            // ... other custom properties
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>
