# Creating a provider

This guide assumes you've already configured the `TestProvider` project in the `providers` folder. Now, let's continue from the previous section.

## Provider project structure

As noted in the "[Creating a custom provider](/getting-started/installation#creating-a-custom-provider)" step, your project structure follows a standard Kotlin/Java Gradle module setup:

```
TestProvider/
├── build.gradle.kts            # Provider-specific build configuration
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       ├── kotlin/             # Your provider's source code
│       │   └── com/
│       │       └── example/
│       │           └── testProvider/
│       │               └── TestProvider.kt
│       └── res/                # Resources (if needed)
└── README.md                   # Provider-specific documentation (optional)
```

Ensure that the `TestProvider` project—or any provider you create—follows this structure within the `providers` folder.

<Note>
    The package hierarchy inside the source set folder (`src/main/kotlin` or `src/main/java`) doesn't need to match exactly, but the `build.gradle.kts` file and source set folder should always be present.
</Note>

I'll create a user-friendly markdown documentation for the Provider class.

Here's the corrected and improved documentation:

## Creating a Provider class

The Provider class serves as the foundation for all providers in the application. It contains essential provider information and functionality.

The [core stubs library](/provider/configuration#core-stubs-library) provides well-documented code - simply hover over any variable or method that is directly taken from the library to display its information.

One of its key methods is `getApi()`, which returns all the API functionality and use cases for your provider that the app will need on runtime.

To create a new provider:
<Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Create a new class that extends `Provider`

        <Warning>
            Every `Provider` class must be annotated with the `FlixclusiveProvider` annotation!
        </Warning>

        ```kotlin
        import com.flixclusive.provider.FlixclusiveProvider
        import com.flixclusive.provider.Provider
        // ...

        @FlixclusiveProvider
        class TestProvider : Provider() {
            // ...
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
        ### Override the `getApi()` method

        <Note>
            The `OkHttpClient` here is a *global* network client used by the app. It is pre-configured with the user's preferred settings (i.e., DoH).
            
            Though, you are still allowed to pass your own network client here as long as it makes your provider work.
        </Note>

        ```kotlin
        import android.content.Context
        import com.flixclusive.provider.ProviderApi
        import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
        // ...

        class TestProvider : Provider() {
            override fun getApi(
                context: Context,
                client: OkHttpClient
            ): ProviderApi {
                TODO("Return the TestProviderApi.")
            }
        }
        ```
    </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

For a detailed information on the Provider class, look at its [API reference](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/provider/com.flixclusive.provider/-provider/index.html).

## Creating an API class

In order to return something on the overriden `getApi()` method, you're required to create an API class that will hold most functionalities of your provider.

A `ProviderApi` class has two properties that needs to be passed on its constructor:
1. an `OkHttpClient`; and
2. the `Provider` class that we've made on the previous step.

### Create a new class that extends `ProviderApi`

```kotlin
import com.flixclusive.provider.Provider
import com.flixclusive.provider.ProviderApi
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
// ...

class TestProviderApi(
    client: OkHttpClient,
    provider: Provider
) : ProviderApi(client, provider) {
    // ... some overriden fields
}
```

### Things you can override in a `ProviderApi` class

| Property/Method | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `baseUrl` | Define the base URL of your provider's API/website. |
| `testFilm` | Specify a test film for validating provider functionality. |
| `catalogs` | Define available media catalogs/categories in your provider that the app will load on the home and search screen. |
| `filters` | Set up filters that users can apply when searching. |
| `getCatalogItems()` | Fetch and display items from a specific catalog. |
| `getFilmDetails()` | Get detailed information or metadata about a specific film. |
| `getLinks()` | Retrieve media links for a film. |
| `search()` | Search for films using various criteria (title, IDs, filters) |

All these methods have default implementations. Override them to provide your provider-specific functionality. For a detailed information on this table, see the [API reference](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/provider/com.flixclusive.provider/-provider-api/index.html).

## Final output

To complete your provider implementation, you'll need to connect your Provider class with your ProviderApi. The final output of the files should be similar below:

<CodeGroup>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='TestProvider.kt'>
        ```kotlin
        import android.content.Context
        import com.flixclusive.provider.FlixclusiveProvider
        import com.flixclusive.provider.ProviderApi
        import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
        // ...
        
        @FlixclusiveProvider
        class TestProvider : Provider() {
            override fun getApi(
                context: Context,
                client: OkHttpClient
            ): ProviderApi {
                return TestProviderApi(
                    client = client,
                    provider = this
                )
            }
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
    <CodeGroup.Code title='TestProviderApi.kt'>
        ```kotlin
        import com.flixclusive.provider.Provider
        import com.flixclusive.provider.ProviderApi
        import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
        // ...

        class TestProviderApi(
            client: OkHttpClient,
            provider: Provider
        ) : ProviderApi(client, provider) {
            // ... some overriden fields
        }
        ```
    </CodeGroup.Code>
</CodeGroup>

Lastly, deploy the provider to the app using the following command:

<Tabs items={["Using the pre/release app", "Using the debug app"]}>
   <Tabs.Tab>
      If you are developing using the *release* or *pre-release* version of the app, run the following command:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew :TestProvider:deployWithAdb
      ```
   </Tabs.Tab>
   <Tabs.Tab>
      If you are developing using the *debug* app, run the following command:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew :TestProvider:deployWithAdb --debug-app
      ```
   </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After successful deployment, your provider should appear in the app's provider list.
