# Overview

Learn brief information about how provider works.

## What makes a provider?

At its core, a provider in Flixclusive consists of two essential components working together:

### Provider APIs
<Note>
    The [`Provider`](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/provider/com.flixclusive.provider/-provider/index.html) class is different from the `ProviderAPI`.
</Note>
The [`ProviderApi`](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/provider/com.flixclusive.provider/-provider-api/index.html) class serves as the functional backbone of a provider. It:
- Handles all the actual operations
- Manages content fetching
- Processes media requests
- Controls provider behavior

### Provider information
The [`ProviderData`](https://flixclusiveorg.github.io/core-stubs/model-provider/com.flixclusive.model.provider/-provider-data/index.html) class contains all the metadata and configuration details. It:
- Defines provider identity
- Specifies capabilities
- Stores configuration
- Manages provider properties

These two components work together seamlessly to create a complete provider experience. While the API handles the *how* of content delivery, the ProviderData manages the *what* and *who* of your provider.

## How they work together

Think of it this way:
- `ProviderApi` is like an engine - it does all the work
- `ProviderData` is like a driver's manual - it tells the app what the provider can do and how to use it
