# Search Filters

Before diving into the search implementation, it's essential to understand how search filters work within the provider system.

## Overview

In the `ProviderApi` class, there's a `filters` property that you can override to define custom search filters. These filters allow users to refine their searches, providing a more tailored experience in the Flixclusive app.

```kotlin
class TestProviderApi(
    client: OkHttpClient,
    provider: Provider
) : ProviderApi(client, provider) {
    override val filters: FilterList = FilterList(
        // ...
    )
}
```

To create your own search filters, you'll need to understand how the different filter types work. Check out the next three sections to learn about each filter type and how they can be used to enhance the search experience for your users.

## Filter

The `Filter` is a sealed class that provides a flexible way to define and manage various types of filters within the Flixclusive app. This structure, originally inspired by the Tachiyomi project, allows for different filter typesâ€”each represented by a subclass with its own unique behavior and state.

Below are examples showing how to instantiate each filter type:

```kotlin
// Select filter for choosing a genre
val genreFilter = Filter.Select(
    name = "Genre",
    options = listOf("Action", "Comedy", "Drama"),
    state = 0 // Default to the first option (e.g., "Action")
)

// CheckBox filter for HD content
val hdFilter = Filter.CheckBox(
    name = "HD Only",
    state = true // Default to checked (only show HD content)
)

// TriState filter for availability
val availabilityFilter = Filter.TriState(
    name = "Availability",
    state = Filter.TriState.STATE_UNSELECTED // Default to unselected
)

// Sort filter for sorting by popularity or release date
val sortFilter = Filter.Sort(
    name = "Sort By",
    options = listOf("Popularity", "Release Date"),
    state = Filter.Sort.Selection(index = 0, ascending = true) // Default to ascending by popularity
)
```

### Types

The `Filter` class includes the following filter types:

| Type              | Description                                                                                   | State                                | Use Case Example                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Select**         | A filter with multiple selectable options.                                                    | Stores the index of the selected option. | Selecting a genre like "Action" or "Drama."   |
| **CheckBox**       | A simple on/off toggle.                                                                       | `true` (checked) or `false` (unchecked) | Enabling or disabling "HD Only" content.      |
| **TriState**       | A three-state filter with unselected, selected, and indeterminate options.                    | `0` (unselected), `1` (selected), `2` (indeterminate) | Filtering by "Availability."                |
| **Sort**           | A filter for sorting options in ascending or descending order.                                | Uses `Selection` data class with index and order (`ascending` or `descending`). | Sorting by "Popularity" or "Release Date."    |


## FilterGroup

The `FilterGroup` class is an abstract class that organizes multiple filters into a single group. This helps in categorizing related filters, making it easier to manage and apply them together in the Flixclusive app.

Below are examples of how to use `FilterGroup` to organize filters:

```kotlin
// Individual filters
val genreFilter = Filter.Select("Genre", listOf("Action", "Comedy", "Drama"))
val hdFilter = Filter.CheckBox("HD Only", state = true)
val sortFilter = Filter.Sort("Sort By", listOf("Popularity", "Release Date"))

// Grouping filters into a FilterGroup
val contentFilterGroup = FilterGroup(
    name = "Content Filters",
    genreFilter,
    hdFilter,
    sortFilter
)
```

In this example, `contentFilterGroup` combines `genreFilter`, `hdFilter`, and `sortFilter` under a single group. This setup allows easier access and organization of related filters, making it more straightforward to apply filtering logic within the app.

## FilterList

The `FilterList` class serves as a container for multiple `FilterGroup` instances, allowing you to organize and apply grouped filters to refine search results within the Flixclusive app. Each `FilterGroup` represents a set of related filters, providing a structured way to handle multiple filtering options.

## Finalized output

Lastly, here's how you might use `FilterList` to combine different filter groups in a provider's search functionality:

```kotlin
class TestProviderApi(
    client: OkHttpClient,
    provider: Provider
) : ProviderApi(client, provider) {
    override val filters: FilterList = FilterList(
        FilterGroup(
            name = "Content Filters",
            Filter.Select("Genre", listOf("Action", "Comedy", "Drama")),
            Filter.CheckBox("HD Only"),
            Filter.Sort("Sort By", listOf("Popularity", "Release Date"))
        ),
        FilterGroup(
            name = "Availability",
            Filter.TriState("Available Now"),
            Filter.CheckBox("Free Content")
        )
    )
}
```

In this example, `TestProviderApi` overrides the `filters` property with a `FilterList` containing two `FilterGroup`s:
- **Content Filters**: Includes filters for genre, HD-only content, and sorting options.
- **Availability**: Provides additional options to filter by availability status and free content.
